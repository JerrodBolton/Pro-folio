        <p class="about-info"> Hello there, I'm Jerrod Bolton and I'm a forward-thinking Software Developer. I'm so excited that you stop by to explore my portfolio. My coding journey started with Ms. Shultz a teacher who has been a support person in my corner. Do any of you have people in your life that are influencers on the decisions that you make? Well, with that decision I ended up in the hands of The Collective Blueprint as well as CodeCrew. Their hands are great hands to be in. With that I met Anna and my journey began. Before coming to The Collective Blueprint, I was working at a warehouse, doing the same thing everyday. Then I learned about TCB and their partnership with CodeCrew because Ms.Shultz. I was excited by the thought of taking on a new challenge everyday in the tech field, so I applied. The classes were difficult, we had long days (and nights), and there were times when I thought I wouldn’t be successful. Having a community of peers and caring staff from TCB is what kept me going and gave me the confidence to stand where I am today. I am a graduate of the Code Collective program, and also achieved my Javascript Certified.
